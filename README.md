### Introduction
**Websites are subject to permanent changes.**<br>
Websites consist of several thousand pages and URLs, which are modified constantly. For example: products are added, changed or cease to exist or pages are (re)moved. This can also apply to project- or landing-pages.<br>
Furthermore, relaunches take place every now and then.<br>

**Inadequate handling of the URL can lead to a  massiv loss in traffic!**<br>
Problems originate from the removal of products and from relaunches. Both can cause 404 errors (page not found).<br>
When removing one or more products, the underlying page cannot be generated anymore.<br>
A relaunch can invalidate multiple URLs at one go.<br>

**This will cause errors, if third parties want to retrieve the invalid URL!**<br>
For example: bookmarks in the user's browser; links in blogs or bulletin boards.<br>
Search engines continuously try to re-index the contents of *memorized* URLs.<br>

**As a consequence, the users may be lost and will  leave the page, without searching for alternatives and external partners might not link to your website anymore.**<br>
Lost traffic has to be rebuilt and positive rankings for SEO are lost permanently.
