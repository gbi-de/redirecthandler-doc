### Introduction
**Websites are subject to permanent changes.**<br>
Websites consist of several thousand pages and URLs, which are modified constantly. For example: products are added, changed or cease to exist or pages are (re)moved. This can also apply to project- or landing-pages.<br>
Furthermore, relaunches take place every now and then.<br>

**Inadequate handling of the URL can lead to a  massiv loss in traffic!**<br>
Problems originate from the removal of products and from relaunches. Both can cause "404-errors" (page not found).<br>
When removing one or more products, the underlying page cannot be generated anymore.<br>
A relaunch can invalidate multiple URLs at one go.<br>

**This will cause errors, if third parties want to retrieve the invalid URL!**<br>
For example: bookmarks in the user's browser; links in blogs or bulletin boards.<br>
Search engines continuously try to re-index the contents of *memorized* URLs.<br>

**As a consequence, the users may be lost and will  leave the page, without searching for alternatives. External partners might not link to your website anymore.**<br>
Lost traffic has to be rebuilt and positive rankings for SEO are lost permanently.

### Functionality of the redirect-handler
![Functionality of the redirect-handler](https://github.com/gbi-de/redirecthandler-doc/blob/master/Funktionsweise_des_RDH.png?raw=true "Redirect Handler Sequence")

**Background-query while a '404-page' is displayed on our website**<br>

**Advantage:** the redirect-handler will only be invoked, if the page cannot be provided by the server.<br>

After the optimization the redirect-handler receives progressively less traffic for the "old" URL. This is because the clients (users, search engines) will "remember" the new URL over time.<br>

### Analysis & Reporting
![Analysis & Reporting](https://github.com/gbi-de/redirecthandler-doc/blob/master/Analysis_and_Reporting.png?raw=true "Analysis & Reporting")
The reporting tools ensure a frequent optimization of the URL-managment. URLs that are reported as "404" can be subsequently added to URL-mappings and will thus operate as "redirects" (301) in the future.<br>

### Requirements
A script must be integtrated onn each webserver that conducts "404-handling".
This script undertakes the (server-sided) synchronous communication with the redirect-handler.<br>

The installation depends on the underlying CMS, shop- or system-structure.

### Optional extensions
**Multiple choice & lightboxes**<br>
Instead of a purely technical forwarding (HTTP header are directly forwarded to the client), redirects can be shown to the user (e.g. by dialog or lightbox). This makes sense especially if there are several "new" URLs or to notify the users, that some products will cease to be sold.<br>

**Automatically, well-kept URL mappings**<br>
Movements of any page will be recognized by periodic scans (Shoprocket).<br>
"Matching-tables" are generated by comparing specifically assigned UID of a page with the according URL. Thereby, "today's data" is checked against "yesterday's data".

### Advantage over the redirect by .htaccess
##### Up to now:
**On the server-side, redirects are mostly processed via .htaccess.**<br>
* The installation of the redirect-/matching-table via .htaccess is disadvantageous (performance-wise) for every single request, because the web-server processes the table without caching.<br>
* The matching-tables are adminstrated via Excel, which means: no valid revision control, no reportings and no user interface for the maintenance of the tables.<br>

##### New:
**The redirect-handler engages itself in the error handling of the webserver.**<br>
* Valid "200" requests are never affected.<br>
* Malfunctioning requests are enqueued for correction.<br>
* The performance of the redirect-handler can be observed and regulated via the reporting tool. Corrupt links can be corrected in external systems.<br>
* Matching-tables are generated automatically.
